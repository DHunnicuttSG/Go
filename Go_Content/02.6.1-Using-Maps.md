# 🏗 Real App Example: Contact Manager (Using Maps)

Imagine you’re building a **Contact Manager** app.

Each contact has:

* Name
* Phone
* Email

### Real life version (how your brain thinks):

> “When I type someone’s name, I want their information instantly.”

That’s a **map use-case.**

You don’t want:

* The 15th person
* The 2nd person
* The last person

You want:

> **“Get me David.”**

This is why maps exist.

## 🗂 Think of your contact list like this:

| Name  | Phone    | Email                             |
| ----- | -------- | --------------------------------- |
| David | 555-1111 | [d@email.com](mailto:d@email.com) |
| Maria | 555-2222 | [m@email.com](mailto:m@email.com) |
| James | 555-3333 | [j@email.com](mailto:j@email.com) |

Now imagine this is stored as a Go map:

```go
contacts := map[string]Contact{
    "David": {Name: "David", Phone: "555-1111", Email: "d@email.com"},
    "Maria": {Name: "Maria", Phone: "555-2222", Email: "m@email.com"},
    "James": {Name: "James", Phone: "555-3333", Email: "j@email.com"},
}
```

This map means:

```
"David" → Contact info
"Maria" → Contact info
"James" → Contact info
```

### Ask yourself this:

If your map had **1 million** contacts…
Finding “David” is STILL instant.

That’s the power.

## ✅ Real App Actions (Using Maps)

### 1. Get a contact (lookup)

```go
contact, found := contacts["David"]

if found {
    fmt.Println("Phone:", contact.Phone)
} else {
    fmt.Println("Contact not found")
}
```

Think of this like typing a name into a search bar.

Fast. No looping through a list.

---

### 2. Add a new contact

```go
contacts["Alex"] = Contact{
    Name: "Alex",
    Phone: "555-4444",
    Email: "a@email.com",
}
```

No special “add” method.
Just assign it a key.

---

### 3. Update a contact

Same exact code as adding:

```go
contacts["David"] = Contact{
    Name: "David",
    Phone: "555-9999",
    Email: "new@email.com",
}
```

In Go, **add and update are the same line.**
That’s powerful.

---

### 4. Delete a contact

```go
delete(contacts, "James")
```

Boom — erased.

---

### 5. Show all contacts (list view)

```go
for name, info := range contacts {
    fmt.Println(name, "-", info.Phone, "-", info.Email)
}
```

This is like printing your entire phone book.

⚠ Remember: Order is random.

If order matters → use a slice + map combo (we’ll do that later).

# 🏗 Mini Real App Example

Here’s a **simple working version that runs in the terminal**:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Contact struct {
	Name  string
	Phone string
	Email string
}

func main() {
	contacts := make(map[string]Contact)

	// Add contacts
	contacts["David"] = Contact{"David", "555-1111", "d@email.com"}
	contacts["Maria"] = Contact{"Maria", "555-2222", "m@email.com"}

	// Get a contact
	c, found := contacts["David"]
	if found {
		fmt.Println("Found:", c.Name, c.Phone, c.Email)
	}

	// Update
	contacts["David"] = Contact{"David", "555-9999", "new@email.com"}

	// List all
	fmt.Println("\nAll contacts:")
	for _, info := range contacts {
		fmt.Println(info.Name, "-", info.Phone, "-", info.Email)
	}

	// Delete one
	delete(contacts, "Maria")

	fmt.Println("\nAfter delete:")
	for _, info := range contacts {
		fmt.Println(info.Name)
	}
}
```

This is already a **complete mini backend** for a real app.

## ✅ Real-life places you WILL see maps

Maps are used in almost every big system:

| App          | Map is used for          |
| ------------ | ------------------------ |
| Login system | username → password hash |
| Web server   | URL → handler function   |
| Cache        | key → stored data        |
| Browser      | site → data              |
| Game         | playerID → stats         |
| OS           | processID → status       |

If you know maps, you understand **how real apps think**.

## 🧠 Pro developer pattern

In real systems, devs often use:

```go
map[int]User        // database ID → user object
map[string]bool     // fast lookup set
map[string][]Task   // user → list of tasks
```

Because it’s:
✔ Fast
✔ Clean
✔ Powerful
✔ Simple

## 🌟 Challenge for you

Without looking back, try to write:

* A map for:

* username → age
* Add 3 people
* Print one
* Delete one
